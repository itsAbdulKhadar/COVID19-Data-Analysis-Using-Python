# COVID19 Data Analysis Using Python
By the end of this project, you will learn how to preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis. in this project we are going to work with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also we have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. We are going to merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
